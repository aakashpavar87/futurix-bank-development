        Open a bank account
      </h3>
      <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4 ml-10">
        The first step is opening a bank account online or visiting the bank
        branch. Some new-age banks only have an online presence. So you have to
        visit the bank's online website and follow the steps for account
        opening.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-2xl font-bold text-orange-500 mb-4 ml-10 transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-105">
        Create the online account
      </h3>
      <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4 ml-10">
        The next step is to create a net banking account. This can be done with
        your account number, date of birth, or any other identification set by
        the bank.
      </p>

      </h3>
      <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4 ml-10">
        The bank generates the first username and password. To ensure maximum
        account security, you must change it and set a username using special
        characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. Set a password
        that is tough to guess, and avoid setting birthdates or identity card
        numbers.
